Unlike arrays, linked lists have a variable size and can be modified to our needs.

# What is a Linked List?

It is a linear data structure that can be visualized as a chain with different nodes connected, where each node represents a different element. The difference between arrays and linked lists is that, unlike arrays, the elements are not stored at a contiguous location.

Since for any element to be added in an array, we need the exact next memory location to be empty, and it is impossible to guarantee that it is possible. Hence adding elements to an array is not possible after the initial assignment of size.

# linked_list

A linked list is a data structure containing two crucial pieces of information, the first being the data and the other being the pointer to the next element. The ‘head’ is the first node, and the ‘tail’ is the last node in a

# linked list.

There are two information sets to store at every node, thus there is a need to create a self-defined data type to handle them. Therefore, we will use the help of structs and classes. To learn about structs and classes

# Understanding Pointers

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. In simpler terms, it "points" to the location in memory where data is stored. This allows you to indirectly access and manipulate data by referring to its memory address.
